## 1. Introduction

Recently, I developed a strong interest in blockchain and Web3. As a web developer, I've been exploring this space for the past few months, and every new concept excites me even more.

When I first learned about decentralization, smart contracts, and user-owned data, it completely changed how I view the internet. I believe Web3 has the potential to reshape the future of applications, finance, and digital ownership.

This blog series is part of my learning journey — a way to record, practice, and organize my understanding as I study blockchain step by step. Think of it as a tech notebook, written publicly so others can also learn along with me.

If you're a web developer curious about blockchain, or someone who wants a gentle but structured roadmap into Web3, this series is for you. We'll learn together, from the basics all the way to advanced concepts, while building real code examples along the way.
